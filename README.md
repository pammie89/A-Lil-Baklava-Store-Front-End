## Project Overview

This is my Capstone project for the Interapt / General Assembly Apprenticeship Cohort. 
The theme of this Capstone is my daughter's baklava business. The project involves building 
both the backend using Java/Springboot and the frontend using Angular.  This is the frontend part of the project.
